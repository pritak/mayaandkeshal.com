          </br>
          <p> Maya and Keshal did, in fact, meet in Miami over spring break. They were there separately, but met through a common
            friend (Hey, Swati!). Back at Barnard/Columbia, while Keshal was courting Maya, he would dutifully walk her back
            to Plimpton on 121st and Amsterdam, claiming that it wasn't safe for her to walk that way by herself. That abruptly
            stopped the moment she agreed to date him :/
          </p>

        <img class="is-hidden-tablet" src="images/c-6.jpg" alt="c-6" width="100%">
        <p class="is-hidden-tablet" style="line-height:0px;margin:-35px;">
            <br>
          </p>
        <div id="couple-5" class="column column-couple-text is-4">
          <p> After college, Maya moved back to India. Keshal stayed in NYC. They did looooong distance for 2 loooong years.
            That was hard. But they saw each other once a year on trips they took together to Spain, Croatia and Serbia.
            <br/></br>
            In 2013, Maya moved to Boston for Business School. They were still in a long distance relationship, but at least they were
            in the same time zone! The next three and a half years were filled with long bus rides, packed weekends, and
            dread-filled Sundays when one or the other got on a bus to head back home.

        <div id="couple-7" class="column column-couple-text is-4 is-offset-2">
          <p> In February, 2017, Keshal moved to Boston, putting an end to 5 years of long distance. Now, Sundays mean fresh
            brewed coffee, decadent homemade breakfasts and Otis Redding on the record player. </br>
            </br>
            Last June, the two took a trip to Portugal, where Keshal proposed on a lookout point over a beach. Maya was surprised, but
            not as surprised as when they went to dinner that night and found both their parents and siblings sitting at
            the restaurant. Suffice it to say, she cried. A LOT.

        <div id="couple-8" class="column column-couple-text is-4">
          <p> The two have since built a life together with all the trappings of millennial domesticity - a Slack channel where
            they decide what to make for dinner on weeknights, a cast iron pan that Keshal lovingly seasons, and a plant
            family that Maya named and Keshal nurtures (Rupert, Chaco, Clemence, Esmerelda and Earl). Oh, and they adopted
            an Alexa together.

          and is a chance for everyone to let their hair down, sing, dance and celebrate. Bonus points if you prepare a dance
          for the bride and groom! </br>

              <quote>The Anantara Kalutara is a Geoffrey Bawa property. Who is Geoffrey Bawa you ask? He was an iconic Sri Lankan
                architect known for this signature "Tropical Modernism" style, defined by sunlit, breezy structures that
                meld into their natural surroundings. At the Anantara Kalutara, that means a lagoon on one side of the hotel
                and an ocean on the other. The resort has beach access as well as 2 pools.</quote>

          <a href="https://www.eta.gov.lk/slvisa/visainfo/fees.jsp#" target="_blank">this form</a>. You should receive an approval within 24-48 hours. Be sure to print that out and bring it with you!

          <strong> Arriving in Sri Lanka</strong>
          </br>
          Fly into Bandaranaike International Airport (CMB) - Kalutara is about 1.5 hours away by road. If you plan to arrive before
          the 16th or leave after the 19th, see our FAQ section for vetted transportation providers you can use to hire a
          car and driver. You can also hire them to travel around Sri Lanka.

          <strong> Local SIM Cards</strong>
          </br>
          The resort has WiFi but if you would like to get a local SIM card, you can do so at the airport. The rates are very reasonable
          and they fit your phone with a sim right there so its fairly easy. We recommend this option if you plan to travel
          around Sri Lanka before or after the wedding.

            <br> Aka, its pretty darn hot in December, so channel your inner Bawa by bringing airy, tropics-friendly clothes
            (think: swim suits, sandals, breathable materials). </p>
